Performed a data analysis and visualization in power BI with MS SQLt.Hook it up with power bi. I have done more data cleaning using DAX and make it ready so that we can build our dashboard.


Business Problem: As a Data Analyst working at a news company you are asked to visualize data that will help readers understand how countries have performed historically in the summer Olympic games. 

The finished dashboard consist of visualization and filters that gives an easy option for the end users t navigate the summer games through history. Some possibilites are to filter by perod using year, nation code to focus on one country or look into either a competitiot or specific sports over time.
